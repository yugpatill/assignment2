# This file is called "operations.py", and it contains four simple math functions: addition, subtraction, 
# multiplication, and division.
# These functions are like tools that perform basic math on two numbers. 
# When we need to add, subtract, multiply, or divide numbers, we can call these functions.

# Let's go through each function one by one:

def addition(a: float, b: float) -> float:
    """
    This function takes two numbers (a and b) and returns their sum (a + b).
    The 'float' in the parentheses tells us that both 'a' and 'b' are supposed to be numbers with decimal points.
    The '-> float' part means that this function will give back a number with decimals (a float) as the result.
    Example: if we call addition(5.0, 3.0), it will return 8.0.
    """
    return a + b  # This is the actual math part: we add the two numbers together and return the result.

def subtraction(a: float, b: float) -> float:
    """
    This function takes two numbers (a and b) and returns their difference (a - b).
    Just like the addition function, it expects two numbers and returns their result.
    Example: if we call subtraction(10.0, 4.0), it will return 6.0.
    """
    return a - b  # This subtracts the second number (b) from the first number (a) and returns the result.

def multiplication(a: float, b: float) -> float:
    """
    This function takes two numbers (a and b) and returns their product (a * b).
    Multiplying means we take one number and increase it by the other numberâ€™s value repeatedly.
    Example: if we call multiplication(2.0, 3.0), it will return 6.0.
    """
    return a * b  # This multiplies the two numbers and returns the result.

def division(a: float, b: float) -> float:
    """
    This function takes two numbers (a and b) and returns their quotient (a / b).
    Dividing means breaking the first number into equal parts based on the second number.
    BUT WAIT! There's an important check here: before we divide, we need to make sure that 'b' is not zero.
    
    Why? Because dividing by zero doesn't work. If we try to divide by zero, we get a big error!
    
    So, if 'b' is zero, we raise a 'ValueError', which is a way of telling the program, "Stop! You can't do this."
    Example: if we call division(10.0, 2.0), it will return 5.0.
    But if we call division(10.0, 0.0), it will raise a ValueError and say "Division by zero is not allowed."
    """
    if b == 0:
        # This part checks if 'b' is zero. If it is, we raise an error and stop the function.
        raise ValueError("Division by zero is not allowed.")  # This sends an error message when someone tries to divide by zero.
    return a / b  # If 'b' is not zero, we divide the first number (a) by the second number (b) and return the result.
